[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails-demo.png)](https://gemnasium.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails-demo)

This tutorial will create an app using rails + devise + ember-auth.
The demo can be seen live at [heroku](http://ember-auth-rails-demo.herokuapp.com/),
and the code lives in this repository itself.

You can use the following credentials to sign in at the heroku app:
* email: `foo@example.com`, password: `foopassword`
* email: `bar@example.com`, password: `barpassword`

The tutorial is [in the wiki](https://github.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails-demo/wiki/Home).
